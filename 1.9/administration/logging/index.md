DC/OS cluster nodes generate logs that contain diagnostic and status information for DC/OS core components and DC/OS services.

For API reference, see the [DC/OS Log API](/docs/1.9/api/dcos-log/).

## Service and Task Logs

You can access DC/OS task logs by running this CLI command:

```bash
$ dcos task log --follow my-service-name
```

From the **Services > Services** tab in the [DC/OS GUI](/docs/1.9/usage/webinterface/) you can download all the log files for your service. You can also monitor stdout/stderr.

For more information, see the Service and Task Logs [documentation](/docs/1.9/administration/logging/quickstart/).

## System Logs

DC/OS components use `systemd-journald` to store their logs. To access the DC/OS core component logs, [SSH into a node][5] and run this command to see all logs:

```bash
$ journalctl -u "dcos-*" -b
```

You can view the logs for specific [components](/docs/1.9/overview/architecture/components/) by entering the component name. For example, to access Admin Router logs, run this command:

```bash
journalctl -u dcos-nginx -b
```

You can find which components are unhealthy in the DC/OS GUI from the **Nodes** tab.

# Aggregation

Unfortunately, streaming logs from machines in your cluster isn’t always viable. Sometimes, you need the logs stored somewhere else as a history of what’s happened. This is where log aggregation really is required. Check out how to get it setup with some of the most common solutions:

- [ELK](/docs/1.9/administration/logging/aggregating/elk/)
- [Splunk](/docs/1.9/administration/logging/aggregating/splunk/)
